# STX Stacker Stream

STX Stacker Stream is a decentralized utility built on the Stacks blockchain designed to revolutionize how participants interact with Stacking rewards. It enables the conversion of periodic Stacking yield into a continuous, real-time stream of value, providing users with enhanced liquidity and financial flexibility.

## Key Features

* **Automated Yield Streaming:** Transition from waiting for cycle ends to receiving a continuous flow of rewards.
* **Non-Custodial Architecture:** Users maintain full ownership of their locked STX while only the generated yield is processed through the stream.
* **Cycle Synchronization:** Real-time tracking of Stacks Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) cycles to ensure precise distribution.
* **Modern Interface:** A high-performance frontend optimized for monitoring stream velocity and stacking health.

## Unique Innovation: The Velocity & Loyalty Protocol

To enhance the user experience, STX Stacker Stream introduces several unique ecosystem concepts:

### 1. Multi-Tier Stream Velocity
Users can unlock higher "streaming frequencies" (more frequent distribution intervals) based on their historical stacking data. Long-term stackers are prioritized with lower latency streams, allowing for faster access to their earned rewards.

### 2. The "Fluid Stacker" Dashboard
A specialized visualizer that translates abstract blockchain data into a real-time "progress pipe." This allows users to see exactly how much STX is being moved from the stacking pool to their accessible wallet at any given second.

### 3. Integrated Guild Benefits
Members of the STX Hodl Guild receive specialized access to premium streaming features, including reduced protocol fees and early access to experimental stacking pools. This creates a powerful synergy between holding and streaming assets.
